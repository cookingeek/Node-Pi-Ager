With a refrigerator, accessories and the Pi-Ager software, you can build your own aging refrigerator for meat. The software controls the compressor, exhaust air, circulating air, humidification, dehumidification, UV light, light and monitors the temperature, humidity and weight of the meat.

The project is a private project, from meat lovers for meat lovers.

It is not allowed to use the software, e.g. in ready-made refrigerators, for sale and commercial use.

The project is a fork of pi-ager.org. I have migrated the software to Node.js and continue developing it there.
